| index.tsx       | This file acts as the main index file that is initially loaded by the browser within this directory. This file will inject the React components into `public/index.html` to render the dynamic web pages.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| App.tsx         | This component is the highest level component within the React hierarchy. This component both initialises all of the local storage (stop names, saved stops, etc.) as well as wraps the entire perceived React router within the `UserProvider`. More information on this components [here](./providers/readme.md).                                                                                                                                               |
| Application.tsx | This is effectively the highest level Ionic component. This components contains the Ionic router which will redirect the user based on the URL path the user accounts conditionally based also on the `UserContext`. If you were to create a new Ionic project from the provided templates, this would be what is within the `App.tsx`. The router logic was shifted to `Application.tsx` in order to reduce the total complexity of the highest level component. |
