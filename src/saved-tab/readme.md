| Saved*List | Both the `MetlinkSavedServiceList` and the `MetlinkSavedStopList` are lists that show all of the respective saved entries within a list. Each list also contains a 'clear' button what when pressed will display an alert. If 'Clear' is pressed, then the respective collection will be cleared from saved storage and a toast will pop up notifying once this has been cleared notifying the user the action has completed. |
